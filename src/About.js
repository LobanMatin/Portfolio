                <p>As a mechatronics engineering student, my passion lies in integrating software, 
                    and machinery. I am particularly fascinated by robotics. I also enjoy finding 
                    solutions to problems through the creative use of programming. Overall, I strive 
                    to problem solve through efficient and practical approaches. In the future I aim 
                    to be involved in the robotics and prosthetics industry and push the limitations 
                    of machinery by innovating.
